    "Blackjack is a two player card game whose rules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The player and then the dealer are each given two cards. <br>\n",
    "- The player can then \"hit\", or ask for arbitrarily many additional cards, so long as their total does not exceed 21. <br>\n",
    "- The dealer must then hit if their total is 16 or lower, otherwise pass. <br>\n",
    "- Finally, the two compare totals, and the one with the greatest sum not exceeding 21 is the winner. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, cards values are counted as follows: each card between 2 and 10 counts as their face value, face cards count as 10, and aces count as 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given perfect knowledge of the sequence of cards in the deck, implement a blackjack solver that maximizes the player's score (that is, wins minus losses)."
